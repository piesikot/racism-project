# About the Project

A very simple project, kept in a minimalist style, yet functional, carrying an important message that gives food for thought to all opponents of racism.

## Deployment

The site is available live at: [https://racism.wtf](https://racism.wtf)

### Technologies

- HTML5 – the structure of the page.
- CSS3 – simple styles that emphasize the seriousness of the topic, without unnecessary decorations, so as not to distract from the message.
- Vanilla JavaScript – a simple script handling the button that, when clicked, reveals additional content on the page.
- Domain – chosen so that it itself becomes part of the message.
